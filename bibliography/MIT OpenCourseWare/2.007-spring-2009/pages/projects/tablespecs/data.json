  "content":" For more dimensions, see the table solid model, available here. All table specifications are approximate and subject to change. The official specification is driven by the physical contest table, which is available for measurement and practice in the Pappalardo Laboratory.\nTable The table surface is plywood with a rough coating for traction. The table boundaries are standard 2x4s. The inside dimension of the table is a 7'10-1/2\u0026quot; square.\nStarting Box The starting box is a plastic crate approximately 12\u0026quot; tall, 10\u0026quot; deep, and 22\u0026quot; wide. It has a hinged front which becomes a ramp with an incline of approximately 17º and the floor of the box and ramp have small cut-outs. On the inside edge of the starting box, not included in the 22\u0026quot; width, is a 2\u0026quot; wide slot for crushed can scoring.\nTrash Cube Scoring Area The trash cube scoring area is a marked 6\u0026quot;x10\u0026quot; rectangle, with its long edge oriented parallel to the table centerline, and its back-inside corner located 28\u0026quot; from the back wall and 6\u0026quot; from the centerline on each side.\nTowers There are six concrete towers which divide the table into two halves. The tower footprint is a 7-5/8\u0026quot; square and its sides are roughly parallel to the table sides. There are five towers behind the cross-over tube and one in front. The towers are comprised of units that are 7-5/8\u0026quot; high. From front to back, the towers are 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, and 4 units high. Each is capped with sheet steel. They are located on the table centerline ±2\u0026quot;. Spacing between towers and adjacent towers, walls, or the cross-over tube may vary from 3\u0026quot; to 6\u0026quot;.\nCross-Over Tube The cross-over tube is a 10\u0026quot; I.D. PVC cylinder which is slightly elevated from the ground. Two ramps, with inclines of approximately 23º, allow access to the tube from either side. However, the width of the cross-over tube at the height of the ramp (1-1/2\u0026quot;) is only 5-1/4\u0026quot;. The tube may be slowly rotating in either direction during the match.\nPlant The plant is attached to a pulley and rope system at the front of the table. The rope is approximately 1/4\u0026quot; thick and 3-5/8\u0026quot; off the ground. The sensor segments used to measure plant position for the scoring multiplier are 9\u0026quot; long and there are five on each side.\nCans and Trash Cubes Cans, crushed cans, and trash cubes are located on each side of the contest table. Cans are standard aluminum soda cans. Crushed cans are the same, but pre-crushed to a size small enough to fit into the can scoring slot. Trash cubes are \u0026ldquo;compacted\u0026rdquo; cubes of various weights, measuring roughly 3.8\u0026quot; on a side. Trash cube sides are not necessarily flat, however they are designed to be stacked.\nThe locations of the cans, crushed cans, and trash cubes are as follows. Y-coordinates are measured from the inside front edge of the table boundary. X-coordinates are measured outward from the centerline. (The table sides are mirror images.) All locations are of the centroid of the scoring object, measured in inches, and have a tolerance of ±2\u0026quot;.\nSCORING ELEMENT X Y Trash cube 42 24 Trash cube 12 36 Trash cube 36 54 Trash cube 15 90 Can 30 24 Can 42 63 Crushed can 15 9 Crushed can 12 75 A SolidWorks model of the contest table is available for reference.
