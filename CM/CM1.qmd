# Introduction

## Engineering and Mechanics

### What is the meaning of "Engineer" for you ?

. . .

The word **Engineer** (Latin *Ingeniator*) is derived from the Latin words **Ingeniare** ("to contrive, devise") and **Ingenium** ("cleverness").

### What is the meaning of "Mechanics" for you ?

. . .

**Mathematics + Physics** ‚Üí Force, Matter, and *Motion*.

<br><br><br>

Vous avez 18 minutes pour construire une **tour autoportante** qui supporte des poids calibr√©s avec les mat√©riaux list√©es ici ‚Üí

Nous noterons les tours en fonction de:


1. Il r√©siste √† au moins un poids: Oui / Non 
2. $Score=heigth_{weigth} * weigth$

### Reflecting on the design process

- How many teams sketched out ideas first before starting to build?
- How many teams tried multiple ideas before settling on a final design?
- How many teams tried to use the weights during the prototyping process?
- How many teams used parts in unintentional ways (took apart
clothespins)?

# The design of mechatronic systems

## Why is it important?

### Why is it important for you as futur Engineers in Innovation ?

. . .

::: {.columns .fragment}
::: {.column width="70%"}
"Humans are really interesting. If you show them your idea in a prototype form, **very few people will tell you what‚Äôs right about it. But everybody will tell you what‚Äôs wrong with it**."

### Why is it important for you as futur Engineers in Innovation?

::: incremental
1.  Idea ‚Üí Mock-up ‚Üí Proof-of-Concept ‚Üí Prototype

2.  To be able to **choose the most appropriate** design tools.

3.  Fail as soon as possible. 
:::

### Fail with purpose !!

Validation of the design hypothesis

![](figures/Fail.png){width="60%" fig-align="center"}



### Learning goals of the module

::: incremental
1.  Give you the basic skills to be able to materialize a conceptual idea into an intermediate mechatronic design object for a given concept.

2.  Learn the prototyping technologies available at the Lorraine Fab Living Lab.

3.  A scientific and technical baseline to independently design and build a prototype. --**Do-It-Yourself**-
:::

### Specific learning goals

::: columns
::: column
1.  Prototyping phases and techniques.
1.  Mechatronics design:
    -   CAD Modeling
    -   Description of a Kinematic chain
    -   Control
    -   Simulation of a simple movement transformation system 
1.  Fablabs and the social innovation approach.

# Prototyping: An overview

## Prototyping: An overview ?

1. What is Prototyping ? 
1. What is a prototype?
1. Why prototype?
1. When to prototype?
1. The fidelity and dimensions of prototypes
1. How to prototype. The ‚Äúscience‚Äù of prototyping‚Äîemerging research and industry examples supporting best practices in prototyping 


### What is Prototyping ?

‚ÄúThe process of creating usable artifacts at a variety of fidelities of completion, in order to answer design questions and communicate design ideas; with users in the context of use.‚Äù

## In summary? {.center}

>Our bodies, physical actions, and use of tools and the environment shape how we think. The act of prototyping engages our bodies and senses in thought and can be faster/easier/better than mental operations alone
